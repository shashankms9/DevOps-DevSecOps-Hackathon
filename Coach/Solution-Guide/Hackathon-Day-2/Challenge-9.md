## Challenge 09: Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud DevOps Security

## Introduction

Contoso Traders, an e-commerce platform, is committed to delivering secure and efficient software solutions. In this challenge, as a DevSecOps engineer, you are responsible for ensuring the security of your applications throughout the development lifecycle. Your organization has recently adopted Microsoft Defender for Cloud to enhance the security posture of your DevOps pipelines.

Your task is to implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud DevOps security measures by configuring the necessary GitHub actions within your created GitHub repository, viewing the scanned results, and connecting your GitHub environment to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

This is the solution guide, which provides all the specific, step-by-step directions needed to do the task.

## Solution Guide

### Accessing the Azure Portal

1. To access the Azure Portal, open the Edge browser from inside the environment and navigate to the **[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)**.

1. On the **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** tab, you will see a login screen. Enter the following email/username, and then click on **Next**. 
   * **Email/Username**: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
        
1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.
   * **Password**: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
     
1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, click No.

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** pop-up window appears, click **Cancel** to skip the tour.

## Task 1: Connect GitHub Environment to Microsoft Defender for Cloud

In this task, you will connect your GitHub organizations on the **Environment settings** page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This page provides a simple onboarding experience to auto-discover your GitHub repositories. By connecting your GitHub organizations to Defender for Cloud, you extend the security capabilities of Defender for Cloud to your GitHub resources.

   - **Foundational Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) features**: You can assess your GitHub security posture through GitHub-specific security recommendations.

   - Defender CSPM features: Defender CSPM customers receive code to cloud contextualized attack paths, risk assessments, and insights to identify the most critical weaknesses that attackers can use to breach their environment. Connecting your GitHub repositories will allow you to contextualize DevOps security findings with your cloud workloads and identify the origin and developer for timely remediation.

1. From the Azure Portal Dashboard, search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

    - In the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Environment settings** page, click on **+ Add environment (1)**.
    - Select **GitHub (2)** from the list of options.
  
      ![](../media/ex9-2.png)

5. Within the **GitHub Connection** page, enter the following details:
   
    - **Connector name:**  GitHub-Connector **(1)**
    - **Subscription:** Select the existing subscription from the list **(2)**.
    - **Resource group:** Select the resource group over which you would want to implement the GitHub connection **(3)**.
    
      >**Note:** The subscription/resource group is the location where Defender for Cloud creates and stores the GitHub connection.
  
    - **Location:** Same location as that of the selected resource group **(4)**.
    - Click on **Next: Configure access > (5)**.

11. For **Edit connector account**, select one of the following:
    -  Select **All existing and future organizations (1)** to auto-discover all repositories in GitHub organizations where the DevOps security GitHub application is installed.
    -  Click on **Next: Review and generate > (2)**.
  
    >**Note:** The **All existing and future organizations** option is used to auto-discover all repositories in GitHub organizations where the DevOps security GitHub application is installed and future organizations where the DevOps security GitHub application is installed.

      ![](../media/ex9-8.png)

11. On the **Review and generate** tab, click on **Create** to successfully create the GitHub connection.

12. When the process finishes, the GitHub connector appears on your **Environment settings** page.

>**Note:** The Defender for Cloud service automatically discovers the organizations where you installed the DevOps security GitHub application.

### Task 2: Configure the Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub Action

Microsoft Security DevOps is a command-line application that integrates static analysis tools into the development lifecycle. Security DevOps installs, configures, and runs the latest versions of static analysis tools such as SDL, security, and compliance tools. Security DevOps is data-driven with portable configurations that enable deterministic execution across multiple environments.

1. Sign in to GitHub using the credentials provided in the environment detail tab of the integrated lab environment.

2. Select the `devsecops` repository that was created as a part of the earlier challenges.

3. Select the **Actions (1)** tab from your repository home page and then click on **New Workflow (2)**.
