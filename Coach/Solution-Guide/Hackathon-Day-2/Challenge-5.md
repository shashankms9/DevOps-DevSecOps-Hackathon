## Challenge 05: Implementing Monitoring Solutions for Contoso Traders

## Introduction

In this challenge, the user/attendee will integrate Azure's monitoring tools—Azure Monitor and Application Insights—into their Azure-based application. Monitoring is vital for maintaining efficiency and resilience in cloud applications, enabling proactive issue identification and seamless user experiences.

This is the solution guide that contains all of the comprehensive, step-by-step directions needed to finish the challenge.

## Solution Guide

### Task 1: Deploy Monitoring Infrastructure

1. You will deploy the complete monitoring infrastructure using the Bicep template named monitoringinfra.bicep. The monitoring infrastructure includes Application Insights, a secret created for Application Insights, and a monitoring dashboard.

1. Open VS Code within the VM, and then click on File (1) at the top left corner and then select Open Folder... (2).

1. Open the monitoringinfra.parameters.json (1) file. Locate the env parameter in the JSON file and update its value with the deployment ID (2) and then save.

   >**Note**: You can find the deployment ID within the environment details tab of your integrated lab guide.

1. In the VS Code Terminal, run the following command to log in to your Azure account:

   ```
   Connect-AzAccount -UseDeviceAuthentication
   ```

1. Connect-AzAccount -UseDeviceAuthentication Go to `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin` **(1)** in the VM browser and copy the **code** **(2)**.

1. Set the Resource Group Name before running the deployment command. set the $RGname as contoso-traders-rg<DeployementID>

   ```
   $RGname = '<update the RG name mentioned above>'
   ```

   >**Note**: For <DeploymentID>, Navigate to Environment (1), click on Azure credentials (2), and copy (3).

   ![](../media/n61.png)

   >**Note**: Make sure you are in the directory where the Bicep template and parameters file reside. If not, switch to the directory cd C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files\iac

1. Run the following command to initiate the deployment using the Bicep template and parameters file:

    ```
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name "createresource" -TemplateFile "monitoringinfra.bicep" -TemplateParameterFile "monitoringinfra.parameters.json" -ResourceGroup $RGname
    ```

1. Monitor the output in the terminal, and wait until the deployment succeeds.

### Task 2: Monitoring using Application Insights

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the **contoso-traders-rgXXXXXX** **(1)** resource group and select the **Application Insights** resource with the name  **contoso-traders-aiXXXXXX** **(2)**.

   **>Note:** XXXXXX refers to deployement id.

   ![](../media1/cl4-t2-s1.png)

1. From the Overview of **contoso-traders-aiXXXXXX** Application Insights resource, you can set the **Show data for last** as per your requirement of monitoring insights.

   ![](../media1/cl4-t2-s2.png)

1. In the first graph, you can see the number of failed requests for Application access.
