<p align="right">Last updated February 22, 2026</p>

## Challenge 01: Continuous Integration and Deployment for Contoso Traders using GitHub Actions

## Introduction
This challenge is designed to evaluate the attendee/user skills in creating a robust CI/CD pipeline leveraging GitHub Actions. It aims to assess your capability to not only establish a seamless pipeline but also to guarantee the successful deployment of the application. Through this challenge, the attendee/user will set up a GitHub repository, implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, deploy a .NET application to Azure, and make rolling updates to the application.

Here's the solution guide, which includes detailed step-by-step instructions required to complete the challenge.

## Accessing the Azure Portal

>**Important:** You can find the Username and Password within the environment by navigating to the **Environment** **(1)** tab in the left pane then copy the **Azure Username** **(2)** and **Temporary Access Pass** **(3)**, which will be required for signing into the Azure portal in later steps and you can record the **Deployment Id** **(4)**, which can be used to provide a unique name to the resources during deployment.

>**Note:** Numbers and ID's values may vary. Kindly ignore values in screenshots and copy values from the **Environment** tab.

## Solution Guide 

### Task 1: Set up a GitHub repository

In this task, you will log in to an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) and use `git` to add lab files to a new repository.

1. You are now successfully logged in to **GitHub** and have been redirected to the **GitHub homepage**.

1. Click on **Create repository** to create the new repository.

   ![](../media1/09new.png)

1. On the **Create a new repository** tab, most fields will be pre-filled. Just update the **Owner** to **Cloudlabs-Enterprises** **(1)**, change the **Repository name** **(2)** as provided below to make it unique.

     > **Note:** did is refers to deployement id.

   - Then click **Create repository** **(3)** to continue

     ![](../media1/github-repo-create-1new.png)

1. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository and **save it** in a notepad for future use.

   ![](../media1/copy-git-url1.png)
    
1. Navigate back to the **Visual Studio Code** application in which the terminal is already open. In the terminal, click on the **drop-down** button and select **PowerShell** to open a fresh PowerShell terminal tab.

   ![Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](../media/2dg4.png "Quick setup screen")

   >**Note**: If the terminal is not open by default, please navigate to the terminal and click on new terminal.

1. In Visual Studio Code, run the below commands in the terminal to set your **email** and **username**, which Git uses for commits. Make sure to replace the GitHub account email and username.
   
   ```pwsh
   cd C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your UserName"
   ```
     
   ![](../media/cl1-t1-s15.png) 
     
1. Run the below-mentioned command in the terminal. Make sure to replace `your_github_repository-url` 

   ```pwsh
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote -v
   git remote set-url origin <your_github_repository-url>
   git remote add origin <your_github_repository-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   > **Note:** This step is done to initialize the folder as a Git repository, commit, and submit contents to the remote GitHub branch “main” in the lab files repository created in Step 1. 

   > **Note**: If you see an error `git : fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at 'C:/Workspaces/lab/DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files'` run the fallowing command and rerun ablow command

     ```
     git config --global --add safe.directory C:/Workspaces/lab/DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files
     ```

1. If you are asked to authenticate your GitHub account, select **Sign in with your browser**, and you will be prompted with a pop-up window to authorize Git Credential Manager. Click on **Authorize git-ecosystem** to provide access.
