## Challenge 07: DevSecOps with AI-Powered GitHub Actions

## Introduction

Contoso Traders, an e-commerce platform, is committed to delivering secure and efficient software solutions. In this challenge, as a Lead DevSecOps engineer, your focus is to enhance the DevSecOps workflow by leveraging AI-driven GitHub Actions that focus on code review and security checks for pull requests thus leading to improved code quality and enhanced security practices in the development lifecycle.

You need to focus on completing the implementation of the below-mentioned GitHub Actions:

**AI Code Review Action**: AI Code Reviewer is a GitHub Action that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide intelligent feedback and suggestions on your pull requests.
**AI Security Check for Pull Request**: This GitHub Action uses OpenAI's GPT to analyse code in pull requests and identify potential security and privacy vulnerabilities and comment to the pull request with the findings.

Here is the solution guide, which provides all the specific, step-by-step directions needed to do the task.

## Accessing GitHub

1. To access and log into GitHub, open the edge browser from inside the environment and navigate to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**.

2. Sign in to GitHub by clicking on the **Sign in** button in the top right corner of the GitHub home page.

3. On the **Sign into GitHub tab**, you will see a login screen. Enter the following email/username, and then click on **Next**.

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="GitHubUsername"></inject>

4. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.

   - **Password:** <inject key="GitHubPassword"></inject>

## Solution Guide

## Exercise 1: Configure and implement AI Code Review GitHub Action

### Task 1: Sign In/Sign Up to an OpenAI Account

1. Navigate to the **[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/login?launch)** in order to login to **OpenAI Account.**
   
3. Within the **Welcome back** page,
    - If you already have an OpenAI account pre-created, you can go ahead and sign into OpenAI using the following sign-in options as shown in the screenshot below.

      ![](../media/cl6-ex1-t1-s2-a.png)

      >**Note:** Ensure that your OpenAI account has active credits for the generation and usage of API keys.

    - After providing the user email and password, you will be prompted to select an access option. Choose **API** to proceed.

      ![](../media/ex6-task1-0.1.png)
      
    - If you are new to OpenAI and do not have an account created, click on **Sign up** within the *Welcome back* page to create a new free-tier account. 

      ![](../media/cl6-ex1-t1-s2-b.png)
  
    - After clicking Sign Up on the welcome page:

        - Enter your email address – You can use your GitHub **Email address (1)** and click on **Continue (2)**.

          ![](../media/ex6-task1-2.png)

        - Enter your password – Use your GitHub **Password (1)** and click on **Continue (2).**
     
          ![](../media/ex6-task1-3.png)

        - A page will appear with the message "Verify your email". open http://outlook.office.com/ in a private window, provide the Github username and password, open the email from OpenAI, and click the verification link inside to complete the setup process. 
     
          ![](../media/ex6-task1-3.1.png)
  
        - Navigate back to the login page provide Github username and password, You will be prompted to provide details like **Full Name** and **Date of Bith** then click on **Agree** this will navigate you the Open AI Platform.

      >**Note:** Upon creation of a new OpenAI account, the free tier provides you with a $5 credit limit that expires within a period of 3 months from the day of account activation.

### Task 2: Create an OpenAI secret key

1. Once you have successfully logged into your OpenAI account, you will be auto-directed to the overview page of the OpenAI platform. If not, you can navigate to the OpenAI platform using the following link, **[OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)**.
