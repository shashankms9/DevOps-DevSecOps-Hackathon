### Task 2: Integrate an 'About Us' app component in React using GitHub Copilot

  > **NOTE:** It should be noted that the code suggestions offered by GitHub Copilot might not exactly match the screenshots shown within the lab guide. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered tool that generates code based on context and patterns, and its suggestions can be influenced by various factors. It is also important that you have the knowledge on operating and running React Application,s which may be needed as you proceed with this exercise.

1. In a new Visual Studio Code window, click on **File (1)** at the top left corner and then select **Open Folder.. (2)**.

    ![](../media/ex4-task1-1.png)

1. Navigate to **C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2/ (1)** within the file explorer, and then select the **ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2.Raw (2)** folder, and then click on **Select folder (3)**

    ![Picture1](../media/ex7-task1-1.png) 

1. Ensure to click on **Yes, I trust the authors** within the pop-up to successfully import the CloudLabs folder into VS Code.

   ![Picture1](../media/trust-authors.png)

1. Once the project has loaded, within the explorer pane of VS Code, navigate to `Contosotraders.Ui.Website.V2\src\components` folder to view the `App.js` file.

   ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX1-T2-S3.png)

1. In the VS code click on the dropdown option next to the **Toggle Chat** icon drop down **(1)** and select **Open Chat (2)**.   

   ![Picture1](../media1/ad16.png)

1. Within the **CHAT: GITHUB COPILOT** pane, type: `Help me create the new About Us" page in ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2\src` and observe the AI response. You can follow the instructions provided by GitHub Copilot towards successfully add the About Us page as a part of the sample React application that you have imported into VS Code.

   > **Note:** There is a possibility that Copilot Chat not only provides suggestions but may also automatically generate required files such as **AboutUs.js**. If that happens, you will need to click **Keep** to accept and retain the changes.

   ![Picture1](../media1/CL7-EX1-T2-S4a.png)

   > **Disclaimer:** It should be noted that the code suggestions offered by GitHub Copilot might not exactly match the screenshots shown within the lab guide. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered tool that generates code based on context and patterns, and its suggestions can be influenced by various factors. It is also important that you have the knowledge on operating and running React Application,s which may be needed as you proceed with this exercise.

   > **Note:** However, due to the ease of execution of this challenge, you can open a new folder within VS Code and import the solution folder from the Windows file explorer with path `C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2\`. Select the **src** folder. This solution project has integrated the "About Us" page and unit test cases for the same.

   > **Note:** If you wish to continue to manually edit the raw project, follow the steps from step 7 or else you can directly can do from step 16.

1. Create a new file named `AboutUs.css` **(1)** in your `src` directory ie., within the path `ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2\src\` and then add the following code **(2)**:

   ```
   .about-us {
       padding: 20px;
       font-size: 1.2em;
       line-height: 1.6;
       color: #333;
   }
   
   .about-us h1 {
       font-size: 2em;
       margin-bottom: 0.5em;
   }
   ```

   >**Note:** This `AboutUs.css` file contains CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) rules that are used to style HTML elements on a webpage. The specific code you've selected defines styles for elements with the class `about-us` and `h1` elements within elements with the class `about-us`.

   ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX1-T2-S5.png)

1. Save the newly created `AboutUs.css` file.

1. Now let's build a new component for the application. Create a new file named `AboutUs.js` **(1)** in your `src` directory i.e., within the path `ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2\src\` and then add the following code **(2)**:

   >**Note:** If the **AboutUs.js** file has already been created by Copilot, you only need to update its contents with the code provided below to maintain consistency.

   ```
   import React from "react";
   import "./AboutUs.css";
   
   function AboutUs() {
     return (
       <div className="container">
         <div className="about-us">
           <h1 className="text-center">About Us</h1>
           <p>
             Contoso Traders is a leading company in the trading industry. We have
             been serving our customers for over 20 years with high-quality
             products and excellent customer service.
           </p>
           <p>
             Our team is dedicated to providing the best service possible. We value
             our customers and strive to meet their needs.
           </p>
         </div>
       </div>
     );
   }
   
   export default AboutUs;
   ```

   >**Note:** Feel free to make changes in the above code snippet as per your use case scenario.

   >**Note:** Notice that the CSS rules have been imported into the `AboutUs.js` file using the code, `import "./AboutUs.css";`.
   
   >**Note:** The `AboutUs.js` file is a React component that renders an "About Us" section on a webpage based on the CSS rules that have been defined in the `AboutUs.css` file.

1. Save the newly created `AboutUs.js` file.

1. Now navigate to the `App.js` file to integrate the "About Us" page that was created in the previous steps.

1. Within the `App.js` file, enter the following code.

     ```
     import AboutUs from "./AboutUs";
     import "./App.css";
     ```

1. Your `App.js` should look similar to the screenshot below:

     ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX1-T2-S11.png)

1. Scroll down to the end of the code within the `App.js` file and then add the following code to include the newly created `About Us` component.

     ```
     <AboutUs />
     ```
1. Your `App.js` should now look similar to the screenshot below:

     ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX1-T2-S13.png)

1. To run your React application, you typically use the command line (also known as the terminal). Here are the steps:
      - Within Visual Studio Code, you can open the terminal by going to the top menu, click on ellipses **... (1)**, then click on **Terminal** **(2)** and then select **New Termimal (3)**.

      - Navigate to your project directory. You can do this with the `cd` command followed by the path to your project. You can use the below command to navigate to the React application's working directory **(4)**:

         ```
         cd C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2\src\ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2
         ``` 

      - Once you're in your project directory, you can start the application with the `npm start` **(5)** because we need npm to create the Contoso Traders Application. After running the following command within the terminal, your application should start, and you can view it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.  
       
         ```
         npm run start
         ```
      
         ![Picture1](../media/ad17.png)

         >**Note:** If the above command fails, you might need to run the following command :

         ```powershell
         npm i
         ```
   
     - The command `npm i` is a shorthand version of `npm install`. It is used in Node.js environments to install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. These dependencies are libraries or packages that your project needs to run correctly. The installed packages will be placed in a folder named `node_modules` in your project directory.

     - After the installation of all the dependencies, execute the command - `npm run start` to start the application. This opens a new browser tab over the URL path, `http://localhost:3000/`.

1. Click on **Get Started** and scroll down within your static web app to view the integrated **About Us** page.

   ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX1-T2-S15a.png)

1. Observe that the new "About Us" component has been added at the end of the webpage.

     ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX1-T2-S15.png)

## Exercise 2: Generate and run Unit Test cases using GitHub Copilot:

### Task 1: Create and run test cases:

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to **Explorer** and navigate to the path `ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2\src\components` and open the `WelcomePopup.js` file.

   ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX2-T1-S1.png)

2. Select all code lines `[CTRL+A]` of `WelcomePopup.js` file **(1)** and then paste the following prompt **(2)** within the GitHub Copilot Chat Panel and press enter:

   ```
   /tests create a tasts case file and add test code code
   ```

   > **Note:** There is a possibility that Copilot Chat not only provides suggestions but may also automatically generate required files such as **WelcomePopup.test.js**. If that happens, you will need to click **Keep** to accept and retain the changes.

   ![Picture1](../media1/ad18.png)

   ![Picture1](../media1/ad18a.png)

3. Now create a new file named `WelcomePopup.test.js` under the path `ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2\src\components`.

   > **Note:** If the file has already been created by Copilot, there is no need to create it again.

   ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX2-T1-S3.png)

4. Once ready with the test cases, open a new terminal within Visual Studio Code, and navigate to the following path/directory by running the below command within the terminal:

   ```
   cd C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2\src\ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2\src\components
   ```

   > **Note:** Ensure that your current working directory within the terminal has the `components` folder in its present path. In this scenario, the `components` folder is present inside the `/src` directory. 

6. To execute the unit test cases generated by GitHub Copilot, we need to run the `WelcomePopup.test.js` file using the following command within the terminal:

   ```
   npm run test
   ```

7. Post execution of the above unit test, you must ensure to have a successful - `PASS` test runs with no errors. If you are presented with errors, please understand the intricacies of the error as mentioned within the terminal and work towards a successful unit test run.

   > **Note:** You may need to scroll up in your output window to view the results.

   ![Picture1](../media/CL7-EX2-T1-S7.png)

## Exercise 3: Code Review and Security Check

### Task 1: Submit Codebase Modifications to GitHub Repository

1. Navigate GitHub Organization page and click on **New** to create new repository.

   ![](../media/09.png)

1. On the **Create a new repository** tab, most fields will be pre-filled. Just update the **Owner** to **Cloudlabs-Enterprises** **(1)**, change the **Repository name** **(2)** as provided below to make it unique.

   - Enter your Repository name as: **devsecops-2 [DID]**
   
     > **Note:** DID is refers to deployement id.

   - Then click **Create repository** **(3)** to continue

     ![](../media/n70.png) 

5. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository and **save it** in a notepad for future use.

   ![](../media/n64.png)

7. Navigate back to the **Visual Studio Code** application in which the terminal is already open. In the terminal, click on the **drop-down** button and select **PowerShell** to open a fresh PowerShell terminal tab.

   ![imported-Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](../media/2dg4.png "Quick setup screen")

8. In Visual Studio Code, run the following commands in the terminal to set your **email** and **username**, which Git uses for commits. Make sure to replace the GitHub account email and username.
   
     ```pwsh
     cd C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2\src\ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2
     git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
     git config --global user.name "Your UserName"
     ```
     
   ![](../media/ex7-task1-4.png) 
     
    Run the below-mentioned command in the terminal. Make sure to replace `your_github_repository-url` with the value you copied in step 5 and `Unique-ID` in step 6.

    Note: This step is done to initialize the folder as a Git repository, commit, and submit contents to the remote GitHub branch “main” in the lab files repository named `devsecops`. 

      ```pwsh
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin <your_github_repository-url>
      git push -u origin main
      ```
     
   - If you are asked to authenticate your GitHub account, select **Sign in with your browser**, and you will be prompted with a pop-up window to authorize Git Credential Manager. Click on **Authorize git-ecosystem** to provide access.

       ![](../media/ex2-t3.png)
       
   - After you are prompted with the message **Authorization Succeeded**, close the tab and continue with the next task.

### Task 2: Implement Code Scanning and CodeQL

In this task, you'll configure Code scanning and explore CodeQL alerts. Code scanning is a feature that you use to analyze the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any problems identified by the analysis are shown on GitHub.
