# Challenge 02: GitHub Advanced Security - Implement Code Security Enhancements

## Introduction
In this challenge, the user will focus on implementing security features such as Code scanning, CodeQL alerts, and repository security advisories to their GitHub repository using GitHub Advance security features.

Here's the solution guide, which includes detailed step-by-step instructions required to complete this challenge.

## Accessing GitHub

1. In a new tab, navigate to the **GitHub login** page by copying and pasting the following URL into the address bar:

   ```
   https://github.com/login
   ```

1. On the **Sign in to GitHub** tab, enter the provided **GitHub username** **(1)** in the input field, and click on **Sign in with your identity provider** to continue **(2)**.

    - Email/Username: **odl-user-did_clabs** The Username is similar to this  make sure you replace **did** with your **Deployment ID**. The Deployment ID can be found in the **Environment** tab.

## Solution Guide

### Task 1: Implement Code Scanning and CodeQL

In this task, you'll configure Code scanning and explore CodeQL alerts. Code scanning is a feature that you use to analyze the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any problems identified by the analysis are shown on GitHub.

**Note**: To perform this task, the GitHub repository should be public. If the repository visibility is private, please go to the settings of the repository and change the visibility to public.
   
1. Select the **Settings** **(1)** tab from the GitHub browser tab. Click on **Advanced Security** ***(2)*** under the security side blade.

1. On the **Advanced Security** page, scroll down to the bottom and enable **GitHub Advanced Security** for the repository by clicking the **Enable** button.

1. In the “Enable GitHub Advanced Security for this repository?” pop-up, click **Enable GitHub Advanced Security for this repository**.

1. On the **Advanced Security** page, scroll down and under **GitHub Advanced Security**, next to **CodeQL analysis**, click **Set up** **(1)**. Then, select the **Advanced** **(2)** option to create a CodeQL Analysis YAML file.

1. Update the workflow name to **codeql-analysis.yml** ***(1)*** and review the yaml file. Select **Commit changes** ***(2)***, then select **Commit directly to the main branch** ***(3)***, and click on **Commit changes** ***(4)***.
